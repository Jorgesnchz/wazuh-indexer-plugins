# Setup

The `wazuh-indexer-setup` plugin is a module composing the Wazuh Indexer responsible for the initialization of the index required by Wazuh to store all the data gathered and generated by other Central Components, such as the agents and the server (engine).

 The Wazuh Indexer Setup Plugin in responsible for:
- Create the index templates, to define the mappings and settings of the index.
- Create the initial index. We distinguish between **stateful** and **stateless** index. Stateful index are unique and its data is update over time (agents' inventory), stateless index are rotated and static (alerts).
- For stateless index, it creates the index aliases and lifecycle policies for rollover.
